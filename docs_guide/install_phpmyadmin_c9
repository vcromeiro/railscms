Using PHPMyAdmin with Cloud9
Here we’ll explain how to install a PHPMyAdmin instance right in your workspace.
Each workspace runs its own database and copy of PHPMyAdmin.

First, create a PHP workspace so you have PHP, MySQL, and Apache installed right away.
You can then make sure you have MySQL installed by running:

        mysql-ctl install

Then install phpMyAdmin:

        phpmyadmin-ctl install

After the installation is complete you’ll just want to make sure mysql is running once more:

        mysql-ctl start
        
After installing phpMyAdmin, you were given a link to access PHPMyAdmin which will follow the pattern of: 
https://[workspacename]-[username].c9users.io/phpmyadmin. From that link, you can login with your Cloud9 
username and a blank password.
