Multiple Ports
Running applications on different ports with Cloud9

Cloud9 hosted workspaces now allow workspaces to listen on multiple ports. The following ports are supported (along with the urls they can be accessed from):

8080 -> https://<workspacename>-<username>.c9users.io
8081 -> http://<workspacename>-<username>.c9users.io:8081
8082 -> http://<workspacename>-<username>.c9users.io:8082
This allows things like running multiple applications on a workspace and LiveReload.

If you're using Grunt with LiveReload, please checkout an example here

HOW TO USE MULTIPLE PORTS WITH APACHE
Apache comes pre-installed with each Cloud9 workspace. This way, it is super easy to get started and serving your HTML pages. However, if you'd like to run multiple applications on different ports, here's what you can do: (This is for port 8081 but it's exactly the same for port 8082)

Create a new configuration in /etc/apache2/sites-available

sudo -i
cd /etc/apache2/sites-available
cp 001-cloud9.conf 002-myconfig.conf
Link configuration in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled

cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled
ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/002-myconfig.conf
Edit 002-myconfig.conf and change the port number from 8080 to 8081. Set DocumentRoot to whatever path you'd like apache to serve when your project is accessed on port 8081

Edit /etc/apache2/ports.conf and add Listen 8081 just below Listen 8080

Restart apache with sudo service apache2 restart or by restarting the runner.

Access your new instance of apache at http://<workspacename>-<username>.c9.io:8081

HOW TO RUN PHPMYADMIN AT THE SAME TIME AS YOUR NODEJS, RUBY ON RAILS OR OTHER APPLICATION
PHPMyAdmin uses Apache to run. So previously you couldn't have both it and NodeJS/Rails/Python running at the same time as they both wanted port 8080.

First Set Up PHPMyAdmin. Then do one of the following:

Run PHPMyAdmin on port 8080 and Application on 8081
This is the simplest way. All you need to do is specify 8081 as your app port instead of using the environment variable $PORT. Then you can access your app at https://projectname-username.c9users.io:8081/ ad PHPMyAdmin at http://<workspacename>-<username>.c9.io/phpmyadmin

Run PHPMyAdmin on port 8081
The other alternative is to run Apache on port 8081. You can do this with the following steps:

Edit /etc/apache2/ports.conf and change 8080 to 8081
Edit /etc/apache2/sites-available/001-cloud9.conf and change 8080 to 8081.
Restart apache with sudo service apache2 restart or by restarting your runner.
You'll then be able to access PHPMyAdmin at https://<workspacename>-<username>.c9users.io:8081/phpmyadmin

Extra Information
If you make apache listen on multiple ports PHPMyAdmin will actually be available at /phpmyadmin for every port.
